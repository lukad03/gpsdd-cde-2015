<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h3>

<p>The Global Partnership for the Sustainable Development Goals is an alliance of corporations, foundations, civil society organizations, non-profits, and governments that are working together to  draw on the wealth of information and data that is increasingly available and has the capacity to achieve Global Goals goals faster, more effectively, and with long-term impact.  We cannot do this alone.  There are thousands of people from all backgrounds and experiences that are already working to use and share information to shape a better world.  The Global Goals for Sustainable Development are setting an agenda to eliminate extreme poverty and continue the growth of a world with greater equality, individual agency, accountability, and collaboration across all peoples and sectors.  The Global Partnership seeks to elevate these voices and grow a broader community committed to working together in transparent and inclusive collaboration to solve these longstanding problems.</p>
