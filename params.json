We cannot do this alone.  There are thousands of people from all backgrounds and experiences that are already working to use and share information to shape a better world.  The Global Goals for Sustainable Development are setting an agenda to eliminate extreme poverty and continue the growth of a world with greater equality, individual agency, accountability, and collaboration across all peoples and sectors.  The Global Partnership seeks to elevate these voices and grow a broader community committed to working together in transparent and inclusive collaboration to solve these longstanding problems.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
